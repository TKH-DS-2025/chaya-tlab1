## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

[We are ignoring these values because there was no one to state their decision on current information for sleep and excerise. The data could be lost according to no data, it is misplaced and misrepresentation causes these outliers can be calculated as no data.]

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[Phase 0,1,2 is where the sleep is occured more in these findings because there were misrepresentation of the no data recorded.]

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

[Phase 3 is the recorded or no misrepresentation on excerise. The data show a positive correclation and higher than the maximum heart rate than the other phases. Every data has a numerical and sorted number that is not missing according to Phase 0,1,2.]

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

[Phase 3 has a clean slate data without misrepresenation and the we can see every person calcualted each numerical number without NO Data or empty number.]
