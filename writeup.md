## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

[We are ignoring these values because there was no one to state their decision on current information for sleep and excerise. The data could be lost according to no data, it is misplaced and misrepresented causes there are no reponsive liners.]

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[Out of all the phases, Phase 0 has the lowest maximum heart rate at 93 range. Because the average and standard deviation are lower in number at 64.59 and 8.53, we can assume less variablilty in heart rate in this phase 0.]

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

[During the higher maximum heart rate, phase 2 is the highest at 117, but the varience is too high with a standard deviation of 13.38. Therefore, Phase 1 is where the excerise happens because there is less variance at 9.9 and our average is higher at 87.3.]

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

[Assuming the Phase 0 is sleep , phase 1 is excerise, and even though Phase 2 has a higher standard deviation, Phase 3 has average heart rate at 60.65 which is lower than all the phases.]
